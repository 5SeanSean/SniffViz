My goal is to create a cooler WireShark. This project will hopefully serve as my final project for COSC 3570 Introduction to Data Science, so I plan on using advanced statistcial methods to display data and detect anomalies. I am committed to delivering a very user-friendly experience and a visually appealing dashboard.
